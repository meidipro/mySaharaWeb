# üö® CRITICAL FIX - Vercel Build Issue

## Problem
Error: `Expected to find project root in current working directory`

This happened because `.vercelignore` was excluding ALL source files including:
- `pubspec.yaml` ‚ùå
- `lib/` ‚ùå  
- `web/` ‚ùå
- `assets/` ‚ùå

Vercel needs these files to BUILD the app!

## Solution
Updated `.vercelignore` to ONLY exclude build artifacts and IDE files.

### What Changed in .vercelignore

**BEFORE (WRONG):**
```
# Source files
lib/              ‚ùå NEEDED FOR BUILD
pubspec.yaml      ‚ùå NEEDED FOR BUILD  
pubspec.lock      ‚ùå NEEDED FOR BUILD
web/              ‚ùå NEEDED FOR BUILD
assets/           ‚ùå NEEDED FOR BUILD
```

**AFTER (CORRECT):**
```
# Build artifacts only
.dart_tool/
.packages
.pub/

# IDE files
.idea/
.vscode/

# Environment (secrets)
.env

# Keep all source files for building
```

## Files That Must Be Deployed

‚úÖ **MUST include** (for building):
- `lib/` - Your Dart source code
- `pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies
- `pubspec.lock` - Locked versions
- `web/` - Web configuration (index.html, manifest.json)
- `assets/` - Images, icons, etc.

‚ùå **Can exclude**:
- `.dart_tool/` - Build cache
- `.env` - Secrets (set in Vercel dashboard instead)
- `.idea/`, `.vscode/` - IDE files
- Platform-specific folders (android/, ios/, windows/) - not needed for web

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit the fixed .vercelignore:**
   ```bash
   git add .vercelignore
   git commit -m "Fix: Update .vercelignore to include source files for build"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel will auto-redeploy**

3. **Expected successful build:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Cloning Flutter SDK
   ‚úÖ Flutter 3.35.6 installed
   ‚úÖ Getting Flutter dependencies
   ‚úÖ Got dependencies
   ‚úÖ Building Flutter web app
   ‚úÖ Build complete
   ```

## Why This Happened

The original `.vercelignore` was designed for deploying **pre-built** files (where you build locally and upload `build/web`). But since we're using a **build script** (`vercel-build.sh`), Vercel needs the source files to compile the app.

## Summary of All Fixes

1. ‚úÖ **vercel-build.sh** - Removed `cd my_sahara_app`
2. ‚úÖ **.vercelignore** - Keep source files, exclude only artifacts

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Ready to redeploy
