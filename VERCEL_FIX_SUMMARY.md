# ✅ Vercel Deployment Issue - FIXED

## Problem
Error: `./vercel-build.sh: line 16: cd: my_sahara_app: No such file or directory`

## Root Cause
The `vercel-build.sh` script was trying to `cd` into `my_sahara_app` directory, but since you uploaded the `my_sahara_app` folder as the repository root, Vercel was already inside that directory.

## Solution
Updated `vercel-build.sh` to remove the unnecessary `cd my_sahara_app` command (line 16).

## What Changed

**BEFORE (vercel-build.sh lines 14-16):**
```bash
echo "--- Entering app directory --- "
cd my_sahara_app
```

**AFTER:**
```bash
# Removed the cd command - we're already in the right directory
```

## Vercel Settings (Use These Exact Values)

In your Vercel project settings:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Framework Preset** | Other |
| **Build Command** | `./vercel-build.sh` |
| **Output Directory** | `build/web` |
| **Install Command** | `chmod +x vercel-build.sh` |
| **Root Directory** | `.` (or leave blank) |

## Next Steps

1. **Commit the fixed file to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add vercel-build.sh
   git commit -m "Fix: Remove cd my_sahara_app from build script"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel will auto-redeploy**, or manually trigger:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Click "Deployments"
   - Click "Redeploy" button

3. **Monitor the build logs** - should complete in ~4 minutes

4. **Expected successful output:**
   ```
