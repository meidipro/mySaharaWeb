## 🔧 Vercel Dashboard Settings

Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard and verify these settings:

### Project Settings > General

**Root Directory:**
- Should be: `.` (empty or root)
- NOT: `my_sahara_app` or any subdirectory

**Framework Preset:**
- Should be: "Other" or "Static"

**Build Command:**
- Should be: `./vercel-build.sh` or `bash vercel-build.sh`
- Or leave empty (Vercel will use vercel-build.sh automatically)

**Output Directory:**
- Should be: `build/web`

**Install Command:**
- Should be empty or default

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Trigger New Deployment

I already pushed a new commit (`3ba47bd`), so Vercel should auto-deploy.

**Check deployment status:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Look for "Building..." or latest deployment

### Step 2: Wait for Build (2-5 minutes)

Vercel needs to:
1. Clone Flutter SDK
2. Get dependencies
3. Build web app
4. Deploy

**Watch the build logs:**
- Click on the running deployment
- Click "Building" or "View Function Logs"
- Look for:
  - "Cloning Flutter SDK"
  - "Getting Flutter dependencies"
  - "Building Flutter web app"
  - "Build Complete"

### Step 3: Verify Deployment Success

Once build completes, check:
- [ ] Deployment status shows "Ready"
- [ ] No errors in build logs
- [ ] Output shows "Build Complete"

## 🧪 Testing the Landing Page

### Test 1: Incognito Mode (Most Reliable)

1. Open Chrome/Edge
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + N` (incognito/private window)
3. Visit your Vercel URL
4. **Expected result:**
   - Desktop/Tablet: Should see **Landing Page**
   - Mobile: Should see **Login Screen**

### Test 2: Logout and Clear Cache

1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. If logged in, **logout**:
   - Click hamburger menu (☰)
   - Click "Logout"
   - Confirm
3. Clear browser cache:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"
4. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
5. **Expected result:** Landing page appears

### Test 3: Check Screen Width

The landing page only shows on wider screens:
- Desktop (>800px): **Landing Page** ✅
- Tablet (451-800px): **Landing Page** ✅
- Mobile (≤450px): **Login Screen** (by design)

**To test:**
1. Press F12 (open DevTools)
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + M` (toggle device toolbar)
3. Set width to 1200px
4. Refresh page
5. Should see landing page
